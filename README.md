# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

This design totally developed by flex box and centered by grid. To align items I used margins as basics as it is.

You can see some repeating codes, considering me as a beginner I think it is ok to be like that. And I don't use clamp because this is only for mobile and desktop not tablet included.

By the way the project only done by eyeingout the design and I am not used any design files. Hope you find it closer to the design.
